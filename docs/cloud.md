The [Cloud Demo](app.calltelemetry.com) Environment is available as a rate-limited sandbox testing.

You can attach your CUCM to it, even push CDR records via your unique login. If your CUBE is exposed to the internet, you could even attach CUBE policies also.
The CUBE Integration requires direct public access, it cannot be behind a NAT.
