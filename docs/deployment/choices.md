Easiset to demo in a lab, boots, DHCP, and sign in. 
You can go production with it too, it will automatically start up all service on reboot.
Make sure to size it correctly to the call volume you expect, by default it only requests 2 vCPU - about 100 calls/second.
An example PostgreSQL backup script is included in the folder.
