# Apps
[Latest App Catalog](https://www.calltelemetry.com/features/apps)  
Apps are a modular services that can trigger on any rule event, and even change the callflow.

## What can apps do?
### Alerts
You can trigger actions, sometimes we woudl call these "alerts" via Webex Teams, Email, Twilio, and more.

### Modifying call flow
Some apps change the callflow. For example, a new app TrueSpam does a lookup to Twilio, and evalulates if the caller has a known spam score. If the score is higher than your threshold, the call is blocked.
