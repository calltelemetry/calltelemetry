# Organizations / Teams

!!! note "Each user on creation is assigned their own unique Organization as their email address."

# Add Users

!!! note "This page creates an new admin user with a password."

You can add team members to your Organization via the Organization -> Add Admins page.


# Delete Users

!!! danger "This will delete the user's account."
Remove members by clicking the X on the user.

# Permissions
Users are created on this page with "Admin" rights to your organization. Today the server allows "anyone" to sign up. If a user joins the server web page, they will not gain any access to Organization policies or reports. I will add user roles in a later version.
